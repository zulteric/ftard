      <description>With Ubuntu Server LTS 20.04 Getting my realtek nic to work
When I was deleting Debian Buster on my brix machine, I tried to save as many notes and config files for future reference. Anything that would help me remember how to set up KVM from scratch again. There was this little folder called rt0xxxx or something. &amp;lsquo;Huh&amp;rsquo;, I thought&amp;hellip; looks like some kind of realtek driver. Well, it was. A little voice tried to tell me that I spent a hella time scouring blogs trying to get my ethernet port to work and this was the fix.</description>

      <description>Is there a better way to get those pages out into the wild and free them from your keystrokes and up onto your web server? Yes, and even better than ftp, scp, rsync or simply drag and dropping files, at your disposal there is GIT!
Git is a free and open source distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency.</description>

      <description>I like linux but I&amp;rsquo;m on WinDoz a lot and I use Powershell never PuTTY. I have a namecheap shared hosting plan and I can never remember how to access my site with ssh-keys, for shell access to my server and also using git for revision control and pushing content to my server. Here is a walk though using powershell.
1st check OpenSSH status on Windows. from docs.microsoft
