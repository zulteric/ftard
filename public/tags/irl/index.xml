      <description>So, you have an encoder that is capable of h.264 over SRT? You want to feed the video into OBS? Have you also found that h.265 over SRT is not as well documented as say h.264 over RTMP? I bet you have and so did I. I also banged my head against walls, keyboards, tables, innocent by-standards on the street,.. in all - I - was the biggest obstacle in the way of successfully achieving my 1st SRT transmission.</description>
