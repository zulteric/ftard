      <description>Welcome to ftard.me! You have finaly found a site that is about you!
Or perhaps me, or you,&amp;hellip; or me you and everybody to. You may be asking &amp;lsquo;how would there be a website that knows about you the way that most everyone that knows you do?&amp;rsquo; Well the answer to that question is quite long and full of extremely boring matharymical arithmaticy AlGore-isms.
