This is my 'exhaustive' gear list. I will hopefully update this page regularly to include every major and minor little obscure piece of gear I own. Often times people ask me about a thing I use but I can't remember for the life of me the name of it let alone a link to it. Like for instance my fethed or the exact mic stand I use. Please peruse and enjoy!! :)

### About Amazon Affiliate Links: ### {#note}

My friend, I am obligated to tell you that clicking on any of the links above, provides me with the possibility of monetizing your little click-itie click-ities! You see [Jeff Bezos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_Bezos) is the richest man in the known universe. They say that [Elon Musk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elon_Musk) is the richest but when the Martians invade they will surely kill Elon first, but Bezos will be able to distract the Martians by educating them about his Amazon Prime feature. Which will no doubt keep them busy shopping online.

What this all means is that [Jeff Bezos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_Bezos) has a lot of shiny pennies. If you click a link on this page and eventually buy the product, Jeff,... will pull out one of his shiny pennies and start shaving some penny dust - which will fall on his boot. Then he will look down at my lowly self and instruct me to lick his boot if I want my shiny penny dust. If I do this enough I can eventually defecate an entire penny! =D So if you would not be so offended in helping me on my quest,.. I thank you for your kind patronage!
